# loading the package
To load the functions into memory, set the working set the working directory where this file is located. The relative path links the working directory to the the function loadpackage.R and sources it into memory.

relativepath = "./PACKAGE/"
suppressMessages(source(paste(relativepath,"loadpackage.R",sep="")))

This loads all functions into memory to execute the codes, simulations and application.
